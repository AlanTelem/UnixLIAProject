# UnixLIAProject
Vanier CST program - Unix class - The final project: We are creating a homelab that will use ProxMox containers to switch between different Linux distros. We hope to be able to make a script that will do the same thing for future students. The distros have been chosen on the basis of their use for Vanier CST students.
