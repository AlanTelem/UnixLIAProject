# VANIER CST STUDENT’S STARTER PACK
Vanier CST Student's Starter Pack is a HomeLab that uses Proxmox containers to run many different Linux-based OS’s used within Vanier’s CST program.
<br><br>
It allows students to access different OS’s from the Proxmox interface available on the browser.

## Project Overview
This project is a **HomeLab** built using **Proxmox VE** that allows students in Vanier’s CST program to access multiple Linux-based operating systems through a web browser.

The system provides a safe and centralized environment where students can experiment, practice, and complete coursework without needing multiple SSDs or multiple physical computers.

## Motivation (What inspired this Project)
CST students often require access to several Linux distributions, which can be difficult due to:
- Limited Storage
- Inability to Dual-Boot
- Lack of multiple machines

This project solves those issues by offering a single platform where multiple operating systems can be accessed and managed easily through the browser.

## Platform
- Any device that meets the Device Requirement
- Proxmox VE

Device Requirements
|                          |            CPU            |    RAM   | Storage  | Internet Connector |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------|----------|--------------------|
|   Minimum Requirements   | 64bit (Intel 64 or AMD64) | 1 GB RAM | 5 GB     |   Wi-Fi/Ethernet   |
| Recommended Requirements | 64bit (Intel 64 or AMD64) | 6 GB RAM | 10-15 GB |   Wi-Fi/Ethernet   |

## Functionality
- browser-based access to containers and virtual machines
- support for multiple Linux distributions
- safe experimentation environment
- centralized management interface

## Demo
A live demonstration was conducted using the Proxmox web interface to show container creation, OS access, and system management.

Video: (to be uploaded in a bit)

## Difficulties encountered
- initial networking configuration
- learning Proxmox VE
- ISO flashing issues
- container update management

## Project Status
The project was **Partially Completed**.  
User synchronization across all containers was initially planned but not implemented. This may be added as a future improvement.
